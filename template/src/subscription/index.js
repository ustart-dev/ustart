/**
 * Exports the subscription implementation to be used by the framework.
 * The framework uses the implementation of "pubsub" from graphql-yoga
 * (https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga#pubsub), which is added to the context.
 * You can use all PubSub defined in the package graphql-subscriptions.
 * Example of basic PubSub instance:

import { PubSub } from "graphql-subscriptions";

const pubsub = new PubSub();

export default pubsub;

 *
