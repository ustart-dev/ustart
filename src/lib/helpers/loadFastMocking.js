/**
 * Search, load and merge fast mocking from entities and plugins.
 * The root type of the mock function must be defined as a function that return a literal object.
 * For example:

  User: () => ({
    id: ....
  })

 * This is not the case for "Query" and "Mutation" which must be defined as objects.
 * These objects will be merged with the rest of fast mocks defined inÂ entities and plugins.

 Query: {
    allUsers: ....
 }

 * We have to convert the merged Query and Mutation fields defined as objects into
 * functions that return literal objects to be able to execute them.
